## Analyzing-Road-Accidents-Using-Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-Techniques


### Motivation
- UK police forces collect data on every vehicle collision in the UK on a form called Stats19. [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data)
- The dataset used in this project provides detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in GB from 1979, the types (including Make and Model) of vehicles involved and the consequential casualties.
- Such a dataset can be used to obtain behavioural patterns based on certain rules. From these rules, some conclusions can be extracted which can help to develop suitable prevention policies to reduce number of casualties in cases of such accidents.


### Objective
- The goal of this work is to analyze the main factors that could be the possible causes of road accidents in UK as per the dataset provided.
